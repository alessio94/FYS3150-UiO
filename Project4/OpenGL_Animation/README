This is a very early version of the code (might not work exactly well eiter)
but gives a rough visual impression of the system. It represents a 150x150 
matrix being cooled down in steps of 0.1 from 3 to 1. 
It's interesting to see the behaviour after the critical temperature.

We used OpenGL and GLUT to create the visual animation.

Usage: either run the program directly or compile using the python makefile.
