These are the data and plots that we obtained by computing the energy, 
magnetization, heat capacity and susceptibility for matrices of size
20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150 and 200. 
All systems were run at temperatures increasing from 1.6 to 3.0 with a 
smaller step around the critical temperature using 1 million Monte Carlo
steps times the size of the matrix squared (to have a uniform amount
of flips per spin at different sizes) for each temperature. 
The data have been collected after 50000 steps for thermalization purposes.

We then analysed the data to extract the value of the critical temperature
from the peaks of heat capacity and susceptibility.
